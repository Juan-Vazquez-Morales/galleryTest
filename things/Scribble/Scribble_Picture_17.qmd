## Process Notes

The creatures are creeping in.

Having fun with these scribble pictures. I didn't expect to get to the 17th one already.

None of them have been printed yet. I'm looking at a target print size of 24x36. This scribble picture was adjusted to hit that poster size. I'm likely to print with a border, so now there is room for a digital signature outside of the print.
