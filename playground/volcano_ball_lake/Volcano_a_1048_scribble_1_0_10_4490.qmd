## Process notes

[Cliffs at Volcano ball lake](https://www.crumplab.com/things/things/commissions/The_Cliffs_Of_Volcano_Ball_Lake.html) processed through stable diffusion v 1.5, and the scribble control net with default scheduler. The line art was inverted as the scribble source. Prompt: matt crump style.
